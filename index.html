<p class="foto">
    One of my hobbies is photography. Photography is the art in which you immortalize the moment. The moment you live in is unique in its own way, so photography has the unique gift to send it
    into the realm of eternity. What is the difference between a Van Gogh painting, let's say the "Van Gogh's Chair" and a photo of an actual chair? The painting embodies the vision and style
    of an artist, the yellow color is vibrant, and if you add vibrant color to a static object with a purely utilitarian value, then that object may become art, because it transcends its normal condition,
    bringing life to it. But photography in this case captures the chair in its brutal and vapid condition. Some would say that photography is not an art, but a surrogate of reality. I say that a photo gets
    more valuable as time passes on. You take a photo of your child while he plays or you look at a photo from when you were a little child. These are moments that will never come back, but the instant
    projection of memory from the past brings up nostalgia, joy or repulsion in the case of an unpleasant moment. In this case, photography has the role of capturing life moments that will never happen again.
    That's why photography remains one of my passions.
